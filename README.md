My personal notes on the Swift programming language.

## Questions:

* What is ARC and how does it work?
* How is ARC different from Java's garbage collector?
* What is a property?
* When should a property be strong vs weak?
* Why do strong reference cycles cause a memory leak in Swift (and Objective-C), but not in Java?
* What does it mean to "capture self" in a closure and why can it lead to a memory leak?
* What is the syntax for a property that can store a closure?
* What does inferred typing mean in Swift?
* What is an implicitly unwrapped optional?
* When would you use ? vs ! to unwrap an optional?
* When casting, when would you use as? vs as!
* What is another syntax for unwrapping an optional?
* What is optional chaining?
* What is Any vs AnyObject vs NSObject?
* What is the syntax for a property getter/setter?
* What is a property observer?
* What is a failable initializer?
* What is a required vs convenience initializer?
* What are the rules for initializers with respect to inheritance?
* What is an extension?
* What is guard & defer?
* When would you use a struct vs class?
* What scopes exist in Swift?
